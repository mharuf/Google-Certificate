<h1>Google Cybersecurity Certificate Programme</h1>
I decided to take this online course as an introduction to the world of cyber security and to learn the foundational knowledge that would kick start my career in the industry. The programme was taught with various methods including videos, readings, hands-on labs and quizzes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, especially the labs, where I was given the ability to practise using software including: Python, Linux, SQL, tcpdump, Wireshark, Splunk and Google Chronicle. Furthermore, I completed cyber security tasks including internal audits, risk assessments and incident reports using fictional data and scenarios provided by the programme. The programme consisted of 8 courses detailing key cybersecurity subjects such as network security, that will be fundamental knowledge throughout my journey in the industry. I was assessed and graded at the end of each course with the requirement of meeting a minimum mark. These courses are listed on the certificate.
